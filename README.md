# F1 Cheats

These are the only F1 cheats you'll ever need. Whether it be for the advanved league racer or the casual social lobby player, these cheats are the cheats for you.


## Installation

Here at F1 Cheats, we have an emphesis on clarity, so we make sure to use trusted and well known software so avoid any doubt regarding malware.

```bash
1. Run CheatEngine73.exe to install the software we will be using to edit things like
grip, engine power etc

2. Open Xenos64.exe, which is what we will be using to inject the DLL which allows the
cheat to function correctly online

3. In Xenos64, under process selection, press on new then press select. That will then
bring up the Eile Explorer

4. In the File Explorer, navigate to your F1 game. By default, it will be in 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\F1 2021

5. Drag the lua53-64.dll file into Xenos64

Tip: Keep Xenos64 (PE Injector) pinned to your task bar so you can access it easily
```
    
That's the installation process done! Pretty simple right?
## How to use

To use the cheats, there are a couple of steps required, but once you're used to them, they become very simple

```javascript
1. Start by running Cheat 1, and/or Cheat 2. Each cheat serves a different purpose, which 
can be found below

2. After it's open, run Xenos64 (PE Injector) and press on inject. The game will now start

3. To test if the injection was successful, join an online lobby. If you do not get an
error, then the injection was successful. If you do, then you need to close both the cheat
and F1 2021. 

4. Once the cheat has injected successfully, you should be able to join online games! To
use the cheat, simply input vaules of your choosing into the empty boxes. The numbers
represent multiplication. i.e. 1.952 Grip Rate would be 1.952x the normal Grip Rate
```


## Tips and Tricks

You've now gotten your cheat setup, but there are certain tricks that you should know
before you go out using them online and in leagues.

```
1. When using Grip Level, if you want to look "legitimate", make sure to never go over 
1.025 grip. Anything over that will look like cheats, but anything under will make you fast
while still looking possible.

2. Never use engine power in Time-Trials. Anyone that compares your time to their's side by
side while using the same setup will be able to see the increase in straight line speed. 
However, when using in races, depending on your setup, I've found 1.005 - 1.02 to be the
sweet spot.

3. When using Tyre Wear in races, never set it below 0.5. While Tyre Wear can be a great
way to keep pace more consistantly, and look legitimate doing it, having it set too low
can very quickly raise suspicions, so keeping it >0.5 is a good idea.

4. Tyre and Brake Temps can be a great way to keep constant pace, however, much like the
things mentioned before, there comes a risk. Other people with telemetry data in a race
are able to see Tyre and Brake Temperature, so use this cheat in moderation
